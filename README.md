-- NOTES: --

For the purposes of this assignment:

A day is counted as "unavailable" if it overlaps with a check in date, not
necessarily a check out date.

For the Owner (OR) problems:
Only reservations that end in the year 2010 count toward revenue and day totals
for 2010 (see OR-2).

*Note to self: This program takes several seconds to compile
